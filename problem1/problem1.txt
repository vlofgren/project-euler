max x so that 3x < 1000 = 333
max y so that 5y < 1000 = 199

15 is divisible by both 5 and 3, so if we add all the multiples of 3 and 5, we'll double count multiples of 15. Can correct for this by withdrawing the sum of all multiples of 15 once.

max z so that 15z < 1000 = 66

Your grandma will have told you

1+2+3...+N = N*(N+1)/2

So answer is

3*x*(x+1) / 2 + 5*y*(y+1) / 2 - 15*z*(z+1) / 2
= 3*333*334/2 + 5*199*200 / 2 - 15*66*67 / 2
= 233168
